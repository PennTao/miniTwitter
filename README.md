This is a mini twitter built by using node.js. The main purpose for building this project is learn Node.js and some front-end developing tools, like bootstrap.
I followed BYVoid's tutorial book 'Node.js开发指南' to create this project. The book is mainly on old express 2.0 and ejs template. I'm doing it with express 3.0 and .jade template.
