This is a mini twitter built by using node.js. The main purpose for building this project is learn Node.js and some front-end developing tools, like bootstrap.
I followed BYVoid's tutorial book 'Node.js开发指南' to start this project and keep adding new features to it. The book is mainly on old express 2.0 and ejs template. I'm doing it with express 3.0 and .jade template.

I've deployed the project on AWS EC2 instance, check it out at http://54.187.16.47:3000/
