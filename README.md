This is a mini twitter built by using node.js. The main purpose for building this project is learn Node.js and some front-end developing tools, like bootstrap.
I followed BYVoid's tutorial book 'Node.js开发指南' to create this project. The book is mainly on old express 2.0 and ejs template. I'm doing it with express 3.0 and .jade template.

To run it on your own machine, you need to 
1. Install mongo db
2. Open a terminal
3. npm install
4. node app.js
